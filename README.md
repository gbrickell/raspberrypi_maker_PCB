A robust permanent module, that connects to the Raspberry Pi GPIO pins, can be created by soldering a set of components into a custom Printed Circuit Board (PCB v5.0). The module design, as shown above, includes a number of on-board devices that can be controlled by the Pi (e.g. buzzer, LEDs, etc.), but also allows a wide range of further components to be connected to the PCB enabling more Pi controlled systems to be explored.

Full details about the project are published at <a href="https://onlinedevices.co.uk/Raspberry+Pi+Maker+Kit" target="_blank" >this link</a> and the designs for a small number of associated custom 3D printed components can be downloaded from <a href="https://www.prusaprinters.org/prints/68834-raspberry-pi-maker-kit-pcb-stands" target="_blank">here</a>.
